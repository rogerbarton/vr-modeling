# Adding Functionality

There is a lot of data tied to the mesh and the user input. It is important to know where what is stored.

Generally, data falls into one of the following categories:

1. **Input data**
   1. Data that is used as to parametrize and decide what is executed (usually from UI/Input), this belongs to the C# only `MeshInputState` or the `InputState` if it is shared between meshes.
1. **Mesh data**
   1. Vertex/Face data required for rendering the mesh, this is the most complicated. It must be part of the :cpp:struct:`MeshState` and shared between C# and C++. There is a lifecycle to this detailed in :ref:`Applying Mesh Data`.
   1. Data that is used only for computations, this belongs to the C++ only :cpp:struct:`MeshStateNative`.
   1. (uncommon) data that must be shared between C++ and C#, such as results of a computation (e.g. selection size), this also belongs to the :cpp:struct:`MeshState` 

## Custom Deformation

To add a new deformation there are several things that need to be done. The approach I often use is to start with the 
complicated C++, then the C# interface and end with the UI/input:

1. How the deformation is carried out in the C++, see `Deform.cpp`
    1. Be sure to set which data from the mesh you have changed with the `State->DirtyState` variable.
1. Storing your data in the right place, see `MeshState*.h`
1. Making this callable from C#: declare in `Interface.h` and redeclare in `Native.cs`
1. Integrating with the Pre/Post/Execute threading loop, see `LibiglBehaviour*.cs` and `MeshInput.cs`
    1. How this deformation is executed from C#, see `Libigl/LibiglBehaviour.Actions.cs`
    1. Handling of the controller input to determine when to execute the deformation, see `LibiglBehaviour.Input.cs`
1. Parametrization in the 2D UI, see examples of UI generation in `UI/UiDetails.cs`

This is indeed quite a long list because of the following complications:

1. C#/C++ interface
1. Threading in Unity, not being able to access any of the Unity API a worker thread.

## Applying Mesh Data

To apply changes to the vertex matix :math:`V`, or any of the other matrices in the :cpp:struct:`MeshState` you need to set the :cpp:member:`MeshState::DirtyState` with the appropriate :cpp:enum:`DirtyFlag`. This tells the system what has changed and the rest will be done automatically. For more control you might want to see `IO.cpp` :cpp:func:`ApplyDirty`. 

This is only for data that has to be made available to Unity to render the mesh.

### Mesh Data Lifecycle (Advanced)

This details how changes to the mesh are propagated to Unity and its renderer. The example is done with the vertex matrix :math:`V` but works also for the other data in :cpp:struct:`MeshState`. 

.. note::

​	Unity stores its mesh data in **Row Major**, whereas libigl requires **Column Major**, a necessary conversion by transposing has to be made.

1. *(in Execute)* The developer modifes the V matrix and sets it as dirty: :cpp:expr`state->DirtyState |= DirtyFlag.VDirty`
1. *(in PostExecute)* :cpp:func:`ApplyDirty` is called to apply the changes from the :cpp:struct:`MeshState` to the Unity row major copy pointed to in :cpp:struct:`UMeshDataNative`. Here we also filter out only things that have changed. This is called by `UMeshData.cs`.
1. Once this transposing is done, we pass the data to Unity in `UMeshData::ApplyDirtyToMesh` in C#

## Custom Shader

This is quite easy with the new Unity **Shader Graph**. So no HLSL/GLSL is required for most things. Have a look at the default shader `Materials/Shaders/VertexColor` being used on the meshes. Note that to display the shader in Unity you must put the shader into a material and then attach that to the mesh renderer component on the GameObject. See `Materials/EditableMesh.mat` which uses the `VertexColor` shader. 

Vertex data, e.g. vertex position or uv coordinates, can be accessed via a node in the graph.
